        <b>Background</b>
        <h3>
            I was born in Monterrey, NL, Mexico. I came to the United States at the age of four to pursue a better <br>
            education. I attended Sharyland Advanced Academic Academy an early college high school and obtained my Associate's <br>
            Degree from South Texas College. My favorite hobby is playing chess which I have been playing for the better half <br>
             of the past decade and have competed in tournaments for the past four years. I recently obtained my Tournament<br>
             Director Certification for the United States Chess Federation.
